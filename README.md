HERE A SHORT PARAGRAPH DESCRIBING HOW YOU PERFORMED THE TASK

To complete the task of creating a personal portfolio webpage, I used HTML to structure the content, including sections like About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact. I then applied CSS to style the webpage, focusing on layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness to ensure it looked visually appealing on different devices. I organized the content with semantic tags, used Flexbox for layout, and included hover effects for interactivity. Overall, the process involved designing a clean, user-friendly interface that effectively showcases my work and personal information.
